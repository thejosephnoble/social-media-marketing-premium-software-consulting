## Prompt History
- KB creation sequence.

## Rationale
Overview.md summarizes the strategy-building process with a numbered framework for practicality. Content (210 words) includes steps, tips, example—substantial yet concise. No subfolders; steps can become detail files later. Trade-offs: Focus on B2B consulting specifics vs. general SMM. Naming consistent. Aligns with strategy guides like Hootsuite.
