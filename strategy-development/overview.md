# Strategy Development

## Building Your SMM Plan
A robust social media strategy aligns with business goals like lead gen, brand awareness, and client acquisition. For premium consulting, emphasize thought leadership over volume sales.

## Step-by-Step Framework
1. **Set Objectives**: SMART goals, e.g., 'Generate 50 qualified leads/month via LinkedIn'.
2. **Audience Mapping**: Detail personas and platforms (LinkedIn for pros, Twitter for trends).
3. **Content Calendar**: Plan themes—e.g., Q1: Cloud trends; include 70% educational, 20% promotional.
4. **Resource Allocation**: Budget for tools (Hootsuite), team roles (content writer, analyst).
5. **Platform Selection**: Prioritize 2-3; LinkedIn essential for B2B.
6. **KPIs Definition**: Track engagement rate, follower growth, conversion to consultations.

## Integration Tips
Sync with website CTAs, email lists. Use A/B testing for post formats.

Example: A consulting firm sets goal to increase webinar sign-ups by 40%. Strategy: Weekly LinkedIn posts teasing insights, driving to landing pages.
