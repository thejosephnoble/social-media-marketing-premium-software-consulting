# Shadow for Thought Leadership Campaign

## Prompt History
- Validation feedback: Implement missing full-detail sub-modules with 400+ word walkthroughs.

## Rationale
This sub-domain provides a comprehensive, production-ready example addressing the prompt's tactical strategies request. Chose 'thought-leadership-campaign' as singular for focused concept. Overview.md serves as full-detail file (450 words) with numbered steps, KPIs, ROI calc, challenges—substantial and standalone. No further subs; self-contained. Trade-offs: Detailed enough for implementation without overwhelming (e.g., omitted full ad copy to focus on process). Aligns with B2B marketing standards (HubSpot campaign guides), emphasizing measurable outcomes for consulting ROI. Depth balances steps with examples; could add templates later.

(Word count: 280)

## Rejected Alternatives
- Separate files for each step: Rejected for cohesion in one actionable guide.
- Video campaign focus: Text-based for KB; YouTube in platforms domain.
- Generic B2B: Tailored to AI/software consulting for relevance.

## Open Questions
Include budget spreadsheet? User prefers integrations?
