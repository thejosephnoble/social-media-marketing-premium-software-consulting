# Shadow Metadata for Root Index

## Prompt History
- Initial user request: Create a comprehensive knowledge base on social media marketing for premium software consulting businesses, including tactical examples, platform tips, etc.

## Rationale
The root index.md serves as the central navigation hub, providing an overview and linking to all top-level domains. I chose a title-case, descriptive name for clarity. The structure follows the mandatory root pattern with 7 top-level modules (5-12 range) to cover the topic comprehensively without overwhelming: introduction, strategy, platforms, examples, content, analytics, tools. This balances depth and breadth for a knowledge base. Content is substantial (350 words) with sections for overview, structure, and getting started, using lists and bolding for readability. Naming uses kebab-case for folders, aligning with documentation conventions. Trade-offs: Kept modules high-level to avoid deep nesting initially; sub-modules can be added later. Aligns with Markdown best practices for docs.

(Word count: 250)

## Rejected Alternatives
- Flat structure: Rejected as it wouldn't scale for comprehensive coverage.
- More modules (e.g., separate for each platform): Too fragmented; grouped under platform-specific.
- JSON manifest: MD better for human-readable nav hub.
