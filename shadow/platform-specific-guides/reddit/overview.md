# Shadow for Reddit Guide

## Prompt History
- Validation: Expand platforms with Reddit for community building, tying to tactical prompt. Initial request for platform tips/tricks.

## Rationale
Sub-domain adds Reddit for niche B2B engagement, addressing missing elements. Overview.md (350 words) with tactics, full AMA steps for tactical value. Naming: 'reddit' singular per platform convention. No further subs; comprehensive. Trade-offs: Focused on AMAs over ads (Reddit's anti-commercial stance for consulting authenticity)—e.g., AMAs build trust without violating rules, vs. ads risking low engagement in tech subs. Aligns with 2026 community standards (e.g., Emplifi reports on tech subs, where 40% of software pros seek advice). Depth: 5 steps + challenges; B2B-specific (e.g., legacy system examples for premium consulting). Process: Verified tree via list_directory_tree, created per feedback without speculation. Integration Notes: Empty dir confirmed—no prior content; future merges via read_file on existing subs for updates (e.g., add user-submitted cases). Versioning: v1.0 for this node.

(Word count: 280)

## Rejected Alternatives
- Threads sub: Less established for B2B vs. Reddit's depth; rejected for focus on proven tech communities.
- Full subreddit list file: Integrated for overview cohesion to keep entry concise.
- Sales-focused tactics: Value/AMAs only to avoid bans and maintain authenticity in consulting discussions.

Validation feedback (v2.0), user prompt (initial tactical request), Emplifi Social Report (web:5, 2026 v1.1), Reddit Business Guide (2026 v1.0), Social Media Today Communities (web:10, 2025).

## Notes
Niche: Software/consulting subs for premium targeting (e.g., r/devops for DevOps leads). Metrics from avg. tech AMAs (50+ engagements). B2B filter: No consumer subs.

## Open Questions
Integrate with Discord for deeper communities? Add mod outreach tips for higher approval rates?

## Future Work
AMA template script as separate JSON; link to tactical case studies for cross-domain examples; update v1.1 with 2027 trends.
