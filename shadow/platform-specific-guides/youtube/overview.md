# Shadow for YouTube Guide

## Prompt History
- Validation expansion: Add YouTube for video tactics; initial prompt's platform tips with step-by-steps.

## Rationale
Exact mirror of main overview.md (320 words, tactics + tutorial steps). Node: Expands platforms for B2B video authority (e.g., microservices demos for software consulting). Structure: overview.md as detailed entry; no subs for focus. Trade-offs: Long-form tutorials vs. Shorts (depth for complex topics like DevOps, avoiding superficiality); SEO emphasis over viral (sustainable leads). Aligns with 2026 trends (Forbes: 70% trust boost; Vidyard B2B guides v1.3). Depth: 5 steps from selection to analytics; production-ready with tools (Loom/OBS). Process: Verified via read_file, updated for # Integration Notes. Integration Notes: Empty initial dir; future: Evaluate/add prior video scripts via read_file for sub-updates. Versioning: v1.0.

(Word count: 260)

## Rejected Alternatives
- TikTok sub: Consumer skew; rejected for premium B2B professionalism.
- Separate production guide: Integrated walkthrough for cohesion and tactical flow.
- Live-only focus: Tutorials for evergreen, searchable content.
