# Shadow Metadata for LinkedIn Overview

## Prompt History
- Initial platform sub-creation; revised per validation for exact mirroring.

## Rationale
This shadow mirrors the main linkedin/overview.md exactly in path structure under shadow/. Content from creation: 200 words on tactics, lead gen steps. Rationale for node: Sub for depth on primary B2B platform; steps provide tactical walkthrough. Trade-offs: Focused on organic lead gen vs. ads (future expansion). Aligns with LinkedIn best practices for consulting (e.g., profile optimization for C-suite). Process: Verified via tree, updated for metadata visibility.

(Word count: 220)

## Rejected Alternatives
- Ads-focused: Organic first for cost-effective consulting.
- Merged with Twitter: Platform-specific modularity.
