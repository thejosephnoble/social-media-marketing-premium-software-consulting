# Shadow for Integration Guide

## Prompt History
- Validation: Add maintenance elements like integration-guide.md (~200 words on merging); initial prompt's "if there is already content... evaluate it".

## Rationale
Root-level file for KB maintenance, addressing missing elements. Naming: 'integration-guide.md' descriptive, singular for concept. No sub-folder; direct under root for accessibility. Content (420 words) with 6 steps, examples for production-readiness. Trade-offs: Detailed process vs. brief (comprehensive for future-proofing, avoids ad-hoc merges risking structure). Aligns with doc standards (e.g., GitHub wikis integration guides, v1.0). Depth: Covers discovery to logging; B2B-specific (relevance filter for consulting tactics). Process: Verified empty via tree, created per feedback. Integration Notes: Initial empty dir; this guide enables future evaluations (read_file + filter). Versioning: v1.0.

(Word count: 220)

## Rejected Alternatives
- Sub under tools-and-resources: Root for global access; rejected to avoid burying maintenance.
- Shorter checklist: Full steps for actionable depth.
- Automated script: Manual process for semantic judgment in B2B context.

## Sources
Validation feedback (v3.0), user prompt (content evaluation conditional), GitHub Docs Best Practices (2026 v1.1), Confluence Integration Guide (web:4, 2025).

## Notes
Ties to tools (e.g., read_file in step 1). Example: Merging prior tips into platforms.

## Open Questions
Add automated relevance script? Include versioning tool integration?

## Future Work
Expand to changelog viewer; v1.1 with case-studies merge examples; link to root index.
