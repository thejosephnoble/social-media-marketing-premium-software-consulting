## Why YouTube?
YouTube is ideal for in-depth demos and tutorials, driving 70% more trust in B2B tech services (Forbes 2025). Targets decision-makers searching for 'software consulting tutorials'.

## Key Tactics
- Channel optimization: SEO titles like 'Enterprise Cloud Migration: Step-by-Step Guide | Premium Consulting Insights'.
- Video length: 10-15 mins for value without fluff.
- Thumbnails: Professional, with text overlays (e.g., 'Reduce Costs 30%').

## Step-by-Step: Video Tutorial Walkthrough
1. **Topic Selection**: Choose high-search, low-comp pain point, e.g., 'Implementing Microservices Architecture'. Use YouTube Search Suggest and Google Keyword Planner (target 1k monthly searches).

2. **Scripting and Production (Prep Phase)**: Outline: Intro (problem), Body (steps with screen shares), Outro (CTA: 'Book a consult'). Script 1,200 words. Record using Loom or OBS Studio—include code snippets, diagrams. Edit in Adobe Premiere: Add B-roll of team at work, subtitles for accessibility.

3. **Upload and Optimization**: Title: Descriptive + keywords. Description: 200 words with timestamps, links to blog/whitepaper, hashtags (#Microservices #SoftwareConsulting). Tags: 15-20 (e.g., 'DevOps consulting', 'premium software services'). End screen: Subscribe, link to playlist.

4. **Promotion**: Embed in LinkedIn posts: 'Watch our latest on microservices [link]'. Share clips on Twitter/X. Collaborate: Guest on tech channels. Run YouTube ads ($0.10-0.30/view) targeting 'software engineers'.

5. **Engagement and Analytics**: Respond to comments (e.g., 'For custom implementation, DM us'). Use YouTube Analytics: Watch time (>50% target), CTR (>5%). Optimize: If drop-off at step 3, shorten explanations. Repurpose: Clip to Shorts for quick tips.
