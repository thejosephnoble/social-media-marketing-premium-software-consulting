# Shadow for YouTube Guide

## Prompt History
- Validation: Expand platforms with 1-2 more sub-modules.

## Rationale
Sub-domain adds YouTube for video content, addressing missing elements. Overview.md (320 words) with tactics, full step-by-step for tutorial creation. Chose kebab-case 'youtube' singular for platform. No subs; comprehensive entry. Trade-offs: Focused on tutorials over vlogs for B2B professionalism. Aligns with video marketing best practices (e.g., Vidyard guides), emphasizing SEO for consulting searches. Depth provides production tips; balances with promotion.

## Rejected Alternatives
- TikTok sub: Rejected—less relevant for premium B2B vs. short-form enterprise.
- Separate production file: Integrated for walkthrough cohesion.
- Live streams only: Tutorials for evergreen value.
