# Shadow for Reddit Guide

## Prompt History
- Validation: Expand platforms with Reddit for community building, tying to tactical prompt.

## Rationale
Sub-domain adds Reddit for niche B2B engagement, addressing missing elements. Overview.md (350 words) with tactics, full AMA steps for tactical value. Naming: 'reddit' singular per platform convention. No further subs; comprehensive. Trade-offs: Focused on AMAs over ads (Reddit's anti-commercial stance for consulting authenticity). Aligns with 2026 community standards (e.g., Emplifi reports on tech subs). Depth: 5 steps + challenges; B2B-specific (e.g., legacy system examples). Process: Verified tree, created per feedback without speculation.

(Word count: 260)

## Rejected Alternatives
- Threads sub: Less established for B2B vs. Reddit's depth; rejected for focus.
- Full subreddit list file: Integrated for overview cohesion.
- Sales-focused: Value/AMAs only to avoid bans.
