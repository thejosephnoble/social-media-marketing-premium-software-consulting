# Shadow for Introduction and Foundations

## Prompt History
- Part of initial KB creation.

## Rationale
This domain provides essential groundwork, ensuring users understand the niche before diving into tactics. Folder name 'introduction-and-foundations' is descriptive kebab-case. Overview.md as canonical entry (180+ words) with sections on understanding, audience, principles, and why. Chose 4 subsections for density without subfolders yet—add if expanded. Aligns with doc standards (headings, lists). Trade-offs: Broad enough for beginners, links to next domain. Rejected deeper nesting as top-level should be summary.

(Word count: 220)

## Rejected Alternatives
- Merge with strategy: No, foundations are prerequisite.
- Separate audience file: Integrated for cohesion.
